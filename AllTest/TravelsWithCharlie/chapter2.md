# Travels with Charlie
## Week 2
<hr />
 ### A Look at New Browser

Our second week had us explore browsers.  I also had always used IE and the new Edge, but after experiencing Google Chrome, I decided I like it much better.
<br />
We also learned about working with files in Linux.  It takes a lot practice, trust me.

The browsers and other tools in Linux we reviewed were

- FoxFire
- Google Chromium
- Geany
- Remarkable
- FileZilla
