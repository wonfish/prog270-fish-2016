### It's now getting confusing

We now starting in with Lamp, something I'm still getting the hang of.
<br /> 
But I'm getting better in using directory commands in Linux.

Here's a table with a few commands:

| Command       | Option           | Effect  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| ls     | | list contents of directory in short form |
| ls     | -l  | display detailed list |
|cp |  |  copy file1 into file 2 |
|cp| -i  |  wait for confirmation, if necessary, before an existing targetfile is overwritten |
|cp| -r     |  copy recursively (includes subdirectories) |
