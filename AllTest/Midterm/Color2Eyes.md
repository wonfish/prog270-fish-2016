How Do We See Color?

### The Physiology of the Eye -- Rods and Cones

On the retina in the back of the eye, there are two types of receptors --- rods and cones.  The rods can only detect levels of light and are important~~ in vision in low light conditions.  However, there are three types of cones, each having a separate sensitivity to three different colors of light.  (See illustration below.)

 - Red
- Blue
- Green

However, each cone can see a distribution of light frequencies centered around its main color as shown in the following diagram.

If we look at the distribution for the blue cones, we see they are most sensity to purples, blues and a little blue green.  But notice the sharp drop at the shorter wavelengths -- on the left in the figure.  This is why we can't see ultraviolet (UV) light.  The green cones are sensitive to mostly greens, yellow- greens, and yellow.  Wil the red cones seem to have a broad distribution from yellow greens, peak at orange, and or course reds.  They stop at infrared (IR) preventing us from see IR light.

So looking at the color spectrum at the bottom, we see that yellow at 600 nm will exite the green and red cones about the same -- but less than their peaks.  There will be no response from the blue cones.  The brain then receives this signal of an almost peak response from the green and red cones and then interprets it as the color yellow.  There will be a different pattern from each of the different wavelengths.  However, the differences from lets say 600 nm and 601 nm will be so slight, that the brain probably won't be able to distinguish between the two of them.

Test yourself: how does the eye know it is seeing dark red?
