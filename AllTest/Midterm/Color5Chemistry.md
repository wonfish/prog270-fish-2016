### The Chemistry behind Color


Why Are Leaves Green and Why We Need Yellow Ink for a Printer

What you may have been taught in school and what you can read in simple websites and science articles is ==Not True!==

You were probably taught that leaves are green because they reflect only green light which hits our eyes and then our brain says green.  Wrong!

The chlorophyll actually** absorbs** the color complement.  In this case this several, specific wavelengths in the  blue-violet and red region of the visibile spectra.  The light that hits our eyes from reflecting of the leaves is then missing a couple of wavelenths and the blue and red cones are not as activitated as the green cones, which receive no reduction in green light.  hence the brain interprets this as green.
