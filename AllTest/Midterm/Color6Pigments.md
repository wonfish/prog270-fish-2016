How Do We See Color?

### Color of Mixed Pigments


An answer on answer.com to the questions *"Why do red and yellow make orange?*" was given as follows:

>Because red it a deep colour, and yellow is a light colour and they are on the same side of the colour weel. and if you mix them together the create a blend of red and yellow creating orange, orange is between red and yellow red is dark and yellow is light, its like cold warm and hot water its just the mix of both colours.

This nonsensical answer is probably typical of what many peopole would give.  But armed with the information from my previous pages, we should be able to give a better one -- but it still comes down to that *"it just does".*

The figure below shows the familar color wheel.

So let's consider the mixing of red and yellow.  Remember, that the red pigment looks red because the red pigment has absorbed the light of the complementary frequency -- in this case green.  So the eye sees no green, and the green cones and part of the blue ones are not activated while the red cones are highly activated.  A yellow pigment will absorb the complementary purple frequencies.  (See color wheel.) So for yellow, the blue cones are not activated, but the green ones are a little bit.

The combination of cones that hit the eye from the combination of the two pigment are then a lot of red and a bit of green.  This combination in our eye makes our brain interpret the color as orange.  You can continue this logic with all the combinations.  

I'm sorry if this answer also seems like *it just does*.  But you'll have to take your complaint to God.
