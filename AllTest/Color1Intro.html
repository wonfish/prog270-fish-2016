   Why is this important to computer programmers?
  </h3>
  <p>
   I’m sure everyone today is using a
   <strong>
    color
   </strong>
   monitor.  (f not then maybe you should.)  So we see colors on the monitor, but do you really understand how we see the colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, almost everyone uses a color printer.  (Ok, maybe some of you don’t, but that’s OK.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, in many of the web pages we write, we have to include code to indicate the desired color.  We can use the names of the colors, but more often may use the hexadecimal numbering system where we assign red, blue and green to each have a hexadecimal system.  Or we can use rgb(n, l, m) where ‘n’, ‘l’, and ‘m’ are numbers between 0 and 255 inclusive.
