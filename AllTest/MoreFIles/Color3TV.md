How Do We See Color?
=============

###The Eye and the Color Monitor

The surface of the monitor is covered in a pattern of red, green and blue phosphors.  The pattern my be dots, lines, or rectangles.  A phosphor is a chemical that when hit with an electron beam for example will proudce light.  For example the red phosphorus in  televions is typically a a zinc sulfide mixed with copper and will emit red light when excited.  

The figure below shows the wavelenght of light emitted fom a typical color monitor.  It looks similar to the response of the cones in the eye -- of course this is by design.  Its fortunate that the eye has only three types of cones.  Imagine how complicated TV screens would have to be if our eye had 10 types of cones!
