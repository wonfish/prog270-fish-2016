- [A Walk to 15225 NE 7th Pl., Bellevue](https://goo.gl/maps/8CGqJyyYFVE2)

This the closest way to get from Bellevue college to 15225 NE 7th Place.   If you'd rather
 not walk along 148th, there is an alternate shown thats a bit more residential.

- [A Walk from the Marriott South Park to Bo Jangles in Charlotte NC](https://goo.gl/maps/wLJyJm3Hemv)

I will be in Charlotte in a couple of weeks and will be staying at the Marriott South Park.
I want to have a map on how to get to Bo Jangles for breakfast.  I've been there before
 and they have the greatest fried chicken.  But for breakfast they have great biscuits.
  There are a number of Bo Jangles in Charlotte and North Carolina.  I'm sure I'll visit there
 for lunch also.

There looks like there are some alternative ways to drive from the hotel to Ben's house.
The shortest is not necessarily the quickest.  I suggest to check traffic right before you
leave.
