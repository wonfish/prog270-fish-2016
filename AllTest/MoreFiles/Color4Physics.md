How Do We See Color?

### The Physics of Light

Light is composed of photons.  These photons can have an infinite number of different energies.  Each energy has a corresponding wavelenth.  See figure below.

Our sun produces all these frequencies fom the nuclear reactions occuring at its core.  The visible light frequencies are the only ones we can see.  Many of the others don't make it to Earth or are adsorbed by our atmosphere -- if they didn't, we'd all be dead.  The wavelength is inversely proportional to energy.  Gamma rays are extremely, extremely high energy photons.  They pass right through the earth.  AM frequencies are low energy.  But they too pass through walls -- not because they have high energy, but are too low in energy to be absorbed by any atoms.

So for example, a photon with the vavelenth of 600 nanometers (a nanometer is 10^-9^ meters) will appear yellow orange to the eye.  Remember! No photon has any color;  its just that our eye measures the energy or wavelength
