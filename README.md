# David Fish's Prog270 Repository

Here is where I'm putting some of my files from the Prog270 Winter, 2016 class.

## Git Steps
 - git status
 - git add README.md
 - git status
 - git commit -m "My Commit"
 - git push
 
 Don't ever do a git commit without the dash m (-m).  It opens an editor and you won' be happy when you are in it.
